# flickr_longdistance_mobility
This repository makes use of the public Flickr API in order to analyse long-distance trips on the basis of the georeferenced locations of the photos uploaded to Flickr. More details about the Flickr API such as the data available and the terms of use can be found here: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/

More specifically, this repo allows to analyse the long-distance mobility of the Flickr users residing in a selected country. For this purpose, various scripts are provided that allow identifying the user's city of residence and destinations, spatially and temporally clustering the different locations at the destinations into separate holiday trips, as well as calculating the distances travelled between the places of residence and the regions of destination and the radius of movenemnt at the destination.
